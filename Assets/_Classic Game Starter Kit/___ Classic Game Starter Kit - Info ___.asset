  - heading: <b>Instructions Document</b>
    text: You can find a link to detailed instructions for using this starter kit
      at the following Google Doc. You cannot edit the document, but you can make
      comments if you would like me to clarify anything or add any information.

  - heading: <b>Contents of this Starter Kit</b>
    text: "Most things can be found in the <b><i>_Classic Game Starter Kit</i></b>
      folder.\n\u2022 <b>Importing a Classic Level</b> - Contains the tools for converting
      an image of a map from somewhere like spriters-resource.com into a working
      Unity Tilemap, which can save a ton of space in the final build of your game
      and make editing the level much easier.\n\u2022 <b>Xnput</b> - Once it has
      been drug into a scene, the <b>Xnput Prefab</b> uses the new Unity Input System
      and NES_InputActions to generate data for NES-style controls from a keyboard
      or gamepad. It is accessed statically just like Input (e.g., Xnput.GetButtonDown(\"Start\")).
      If you select the prefab, you can see the various buttons working when the
      scene is played.\n\u2022 <b>MetroidCamera.cs</b> - TBD - This camera script
      uses a series of BoxColliders to ensure the camera follows the player through
      the level.\n\u2022 <b>Classic Character Controller</b> - TBD - This is a simple
      but effective 2D character controller that is a good starting point for developing
      your own player character controller."

  - heading: Importing a Classic Level Tilemap Code
    text: This is mostly built on code from the Dungeon Delver project in my book.

  - heading: Character Controller Code
    text: The character platformer code is a modified version of the GMTK Platformer
      Toolkit.

  - heading: NaughtyAttributes - Unity Asset
    text: This project includes the <b>excellent</b> and <b>free</b> NaughtyAttributes
      asset from the Unity Asset Store. NaughtyAttributes was created by Denis Rizov
      to allow some of the same functionality as the (even better but expensive)
      <i>Odin Inspector Tools</i> in a free package.

  - heading: Image Editing Options
    text: "The document linked above includes step-by-step instructions for using
      Photopea.com, but you can do the same things in Affinity Photo, Photoshop,
      or even Gimp.\t"

  - heading: <b>This is a Work in Progress!</b>
    text: "If you find things that are broken, please let me know. Several things
      are unfinished at this point, and I will be updating them throughout the semester
      and beyond.\n\nIn Fall, 2022, we used the Game Makers ToolKit <i>GMTK Platformer
      Toolkit</i>, which is pretty great as an interactive essay, but I found and
      fixed some bugs in the actual platformer code that they distributed and felt
      that some things could have been done better. When I contacted GMTK about it,
      they said that they had moved on to other projects and weren't interested in
      improving their Toolkit, so I feld that I needed to make my own.\n\nDoing so,
      is taking some time, as all things do. \u2014 <i>Jeremy</i>"
